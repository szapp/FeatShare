FeatShare
=========

Share specific features between projects of same origin

![FeatShare](doc/_static/images/icon.png)

While merge-tools generally allow fusing *all* changes from two versions of a project, **FeatShare** integrates only a selected
set of changes (along with creation and deletion of files) into an environment. This is done irrespective of how far
the target project has evolved from the common origin - and that outside of a version control system in form of a light-weight
stand-alone setup.
Its strengths lie in the high customization of configuration and its flexibility of how to integrate the features.

For more information read the documentation avaliable in each [release](../../releases/latest).
