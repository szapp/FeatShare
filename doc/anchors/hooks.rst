Hooks
=====

A traditional anchor hooks itself into the ground.
Similar to this visualization, in FeatShare, hooks are part of :ref:`anchors <anchors>` and are used to pinpoint
and target specific positions.

A hook defines the point at which an anchor inserts a feature (or, more specific, a trait).

For more details about hooks see :ref:`anchors.hook <anchors.hook>`.
